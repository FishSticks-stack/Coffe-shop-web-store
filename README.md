# Coffe-shop-web-store
This is our final team project created for Web Development course in Summer 2021.
The Coffee Shop features several beverages, both coffee and tea, along with small food items, such as sandwiches, for purchase.
Customers can add/remove items to/from their cart and checkout. Once in the checkout screen users will be prompted to enter their billing and payment information
and finalize their order. 
The Coffee Shop also features promotional images on its homepage and several other webpages that can be found on the navigation bar at the very top of the screen.
Included is an interactive map that displays our shop location and a form in which customers can fill out and get in touch with us.
